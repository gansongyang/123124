Listening tests with pairwise amplitude panning and loudspeakers not symmetrically arranged around the median plane (e.g. when a virtual source is panned between the front right and center loudspeaker in a 5.1 surround setup) revealed that virtual sources can appear significantly shifted by up to 10◦ towards the median plane

non-unitary vector base amplitude panning (NVBAP) 被提出用于提升虚拟声源的定位精度

一个好的upmix:
- 提升沉浸感和包围感，immersion and envelopment
- a wider listening area(sweet spot) 更大的黄金位
- 提升虚拟声源的稳定定位
