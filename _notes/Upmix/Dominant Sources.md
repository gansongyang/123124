在T-F domain，在特定的时间和频率区间，只会有一个dominant source, 可以分离出想要的sources.

T-F domain resolution is quite tricky for practical usage. **20-40 ms, 20-40 Hz** 是一个较好的经验范围

方法一： W-disjoint orthogonality

Degenerate Unmixing Estimation Technique (DUET)，
when sources are more than mixtures, the senarior is defined as degenerate.

**Smoothing is not necessarily**
Smoothing unnecessarily reduces the effective time resolution of the panning coefficient estimate and consequently the ability to separate sources which are sparse in time (e.g. several fast drum hits).
