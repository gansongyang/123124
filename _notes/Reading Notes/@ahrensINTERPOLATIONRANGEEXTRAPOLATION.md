## Abstract
Approaches for incorporating sound source directivity into wavebased room acoustic simulations using a spherical harmonic representation have been presented recently. Normally, the directivity is measured or prescribed on a spherical surface centered at the nominal source position. In wave-based simulations, this directivity can be represented through a locally-defined driving term acting at the source location. In practice, the directivity of real-world sound sources like musical instruments or industrial machinery can only be measured approximately in terms of spatial resolution and accuracy. We show that the measurement data can be augmented such that the impairments due to the limitations of the measurement accuracy are mitigated. We revisit the previously proposed approach of only using the angle-dependent magnitude of the measured directivity together with a spherical-wave propagation model and demonstrate its potential by means of numerical simulations based on two case studies.
