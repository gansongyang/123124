### Time-stretching of audio facing two main artifacts
- transient smearing: refers to the softening of attacks such that the natural percussiveness of the transient regions is lost 轻微的自然打击乐消失，因为算法假设是稳态的sinusoids,常用的方法是在瞬时声音的位置做phase lock
- phasiness： is often perceived as if a reverb-like effect has beenadded to the sound. This is due to a lack of phase coherence acrossfrequency channels in a given frame 因为没有做phase coherence

### 解决这两种artifacts的另一种方法是采用classification of spectral components ，spectral peaks被分为三类
- sinusoids
- noise
- transients,
