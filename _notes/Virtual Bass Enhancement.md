1. However, low-frequency components that imbue listeners with a sense of power and contain the fundamental frequency of the rhythm section are mainly in the range below 250 Hz。所以cutoff frequency  $f_c$  的选择最好在250Hz。
2. VBS把低频的能量平移到了中高频，所以要注意高频的

3. psychoacoustic research found that the human auditory system is most sensitive to the second to sixth harmonics for pitch perception 所以6组harmonics 就够了
