## Abstract

Sustained contact interactions like scraping and rolling produce a wide variety of sounds. Previous studies have explored ways to synthesize these sounds efficiently and intuitively but could not fully mimic the rich structure of real instances of these sounds. We present a novel source-filter model for realistic synthesis of scraping and rolling sounds with physically and perceptually relevant controllable parameters constrained by principles of mechanics. Key features of our model include non-linearities to constrain the contact force, naturalistic normal force variation for different motions, and a method for morphing impulse responses within a material to achieve location-dependence. Perceptual experiments show that the presented model is able to synthesize realistic scraping and rolling sounds while conveying physical information similar to that in recorded sounds.
