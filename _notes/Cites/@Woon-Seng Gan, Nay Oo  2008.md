## Abstract
Nonlinear devices (NLD) are used in the virtual bass system. NLD generates harmonics which in turn create the pitch perception and are used in the audio bass enhancement systems using psychoacoustics. This paper presents the mathematical derivations and analyses of five different NLD devices, together with intermodulation analysis of harmonics generated by these NLDs. The five NLDs are half-wave rectifier, full-wave rectifier, square wave, polynomial function and exponential function. The...
